                    Minesweeper is a puzzle video game. There are 15x15 tiles, with multiple mines hidden within. The goal of the game is to reveal all the safe
                    spaces and avoid the mines. Left-click to reveal a tile, if a mine is clicked you lose the game. The number of the cells explain how many
                    mines are surounding the cell. You can right-click to flag a tile, marking it as where you think a mine will be. Flagged titles cannot be
                    left-clicked and can be removed with a right click. When all of the safe tiles are revealed, you have won the game.
